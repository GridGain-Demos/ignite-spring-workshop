## How to use Apache Ignite and Spring to build a reliable distributed web application

Spring is a popular framework, and Apache Ignite is a fast layer for data storage. Adding Ignite enables you to manage http sessions, cache-application data, 
and so on. In this demo, I use the Spring framework to create a simple web application and demonstrate how Apache Ignite can empower the application. 
  
The steps are the following:  
* Adding authorization to the application  
* Using Spring to store the data solution  
* Configuring Apache Ignite to increase the application's durability
